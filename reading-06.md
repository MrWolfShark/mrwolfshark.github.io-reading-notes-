# Proplem Domains

**Problem Domain**
: The underlying issue or objective; the reason for creating the code.

Software development is reliant on the need to create, improve, or fix code. As developers, understanding the objective of each project and the steps to get 
from conceptualization to a final product can be challenging. The first step is to take a large project and break it down into processes. This is easier said than done. 
First, the goal mmust be understood completely. Then the goal should be broken up into major parts. Sometimes these major parts are not well defined but become more 
as the project progresses. Once the major parts are defined, they should be broken down further into the major functions of the code. This can greatly improve one's 
ability to understand how the code works and allows for gradual build up of the code. Also, building code in a modular format allows for better troubleshooting and 
debugging as bugs can be isolated to key areas of the code.
