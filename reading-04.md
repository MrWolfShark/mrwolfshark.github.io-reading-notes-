# Paired Programming

## **How It Works**

Two programmers work as a team to develop code. Each member is responsible for different parts for the development process. One developer is called the pilot or driver. Their role is to write the code. The other other developer is called the navigator. This role ensures the success of the driver by handling all navigation through the various code documents, versioning, guides the creative process for the development. Both developers work as a team to create highly efficient and effective code.

## **Key Benefits**

1. Even though the code take slightly longer to create, the code is usually of better quality and requires less debugging
2. Team work on projects leads to better solutions and creativity
3. Team members are able to learn from each other and increase coding skills
4. Teamwork drives social interaction which is conducive to healthy working relationships
