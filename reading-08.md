# CSS Positioning: A Quick Guide

**Static**
: normal position; not effected by top, bottom, left, and right properties

**Relative**
: position element relative to its normal position; the element will move within the page

**Fixed**
: freeze element in a static position on the viewport; the element will not move as the page scrolls

**Absolute**
: position element relative to its parent element; the element will move within the parent element

**Sticky**
: element will be in position until page is scrolled; once the element would leave the viewport it "sitcks" to viewport in a fixed position
